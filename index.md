#### About

I am a first-year PhD student interested in [structured editing](http://hazel.org/) and [incremental computation](http://adapton.org/). I am advised by [Matthew Hammer](http://matthewhammer.org/) at the University of Colorado Boulder.

I received my bachelor's degree from Williams College in 2016. During my time there, I acquired a broad set of research experience, ranging from [combinatorics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022314X1500181X) to topological data analysis to dynamic race detection. My thesis was advised by [Stephen Freund](http://www.cs.williams.edu/~freund/index.html).

Before coming to Boulder, I lived in New York City. There, I worked as a software engineer at [Addepar](https://addepar.com/), co-taught an elective [course](https://michelleshu.github.io/web-development/) on web development at the City College of New York, and sang as a professional ensemble member of [Choral Chameleon](http://www.choralchameleon.com/).

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
